### **TURNING TRASH INTO ‘TREATSURE’**

When Preston Wong witnessed his family throwing out uneaten food from the refrigerator because it was expiring, he saw not just wastage, but opportunity. Together with Kenneth, his co-founder, he created Treatsure – an app that aimed to get people to treat food as treasure. It is a platform where merchants can easily sell surplus food to customers, minimizing the problem of food wastage. 

### **READY FOR TOMORROW’S CHALLENGES**

Over the past 10 years, the amount of food wasted in Singapore has risen almost 50%. In 2015, approximately 790,000 tons of food was thrown out. Treatsure turns this food into a source of profit for businesses. Since launching, they have acquired partners such as Grand Hyatt Singapore, Chewy Junior, SaladStop! and more, and created their own ‘buffet-in-a-box’ takeaway concept.

### **SEARCHING OUT NEW OPPORTUNITIES**

Sustainability and reducing waste is something many companies see as important. Practicing those ideals, however, has its challenges. Treatsure makes it easier for businesses to do so by giving them a platform that connects them to a ready and hungry audience. In the future, they hope to be able to take their app to other parts of the Asia-Pacific region.

### **THEIR FUTURE ECONOMY STORY**

#### **EMBRACING INNOVATION:**
* To develop Treatsure, Preston surveyed many members of the public and merchants in person to understand what they needed and how they shopped.
* Beyond offering a way for consumers to pick up excess food, Treatsure came up with a novel ‘buffet-in-a-box’ concept that would give hotel buffets a new way to attract customers.

#### **RAISING PRODUCTIVITY:**
* By providing food companies with a platform they can use to reach new customers, Treatsure enables them to expand operations in an efficient, simple way.
* Treatsure is in the process of developing technology to better study consumer and producer behaviour, and hopes to be able to help companies optimise their food production.

#### **PURSUING INTERNATIONALISATION:**
* Treatsure has received requests to collaborate overseas, and seeks to expand into other parts of the Asia-Pacific region when it acquires the resources and opportunities to do so.

#### **GETTING AHEAD WITH GRANTS & SCHEMES:**
* The SME Talent Programme (STP) enabled Treatsure to defray the cost of hiring in its initial stages, and let them tap on a stream of tertiary institution talents for sales, marketing and product development.
